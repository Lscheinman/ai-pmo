## TODO List
- RFI generator from chat associated 
- Email finder. Outlook search is terrible
  - need to either grant access to outlook OR
  - download a PST file for python to read OR
  - simply attach emails to tasks and make those searchable
- Mindmapping as draft project?
- OSINT services
- GPT roadmap
  - meeting whisperer 
  - AI button drop down or context spinner pop up on entities with menu of AI actions
  - Generate status report for ppt/pdf, base on ppt template... show RACI, tasks... 
- NodeDetails
  - Mini charts
- Project tasks should be ordered by date automatically, past dates go to the very bottom.
- Task dependencies

## BUGS:
- adding person
  - clicking on a newly added person brings up modal but exisitng shows details
  - Adding tag to person requires re-load to see
- creating tasks or assigning people should update graph in realtime
- Gantt, center labels of projects to view. 
- clicking on group in list doesn't trigger network graph focus
